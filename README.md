# FINANCE TRACKER
#### Video Demo:  <>
#### Description:
A Simple and Straight-to-the-point Finance Tracker Web Application where you can keep track of your finances!

I had a personal need in my life for a app of this sort. I keep track of my finances using the (Aspire Budget Google Sheets add-on), but I would only do my entries for my day's spending at the end of the day, and I used to often times forget where all I spent my money, so I would write down the name of the item and the price of the item I spent the money on.

But it felt tideous and too slow as I would use my phone's Notes app, and after taking Cs50x (specifically the Flask Lesson), an idea clicked and I said to myself: "Hey...I can make this easier for myself..and maybe others?" And hence the motivation behind this project.
