#### Description:
A Simple and Straight-to-the-point Finance Tracker Web Application where you can keep track of your finances!

I had a personal need in my life for a app of this sort. I keep track of my finances using the (Aspire Budget Google Sheets add-on), but I would only do my entries for my day's spending at the end of the day, and I used to often times forget where all I spent my money, so I would write down the name of the item and the price of the item I spent the money on.

But it felt tideous and too slow as I would use my phone's Notes app, and after taking Cs50x (specifically the Flask Lesson), an idea clicked and I said to myself: "Hey...I can make this easier for myself..and maybe others?" And hence the motivation behind this project.

This project was made using the following:

* HTML & CSS for the Front-end
* Python for the Back-end
* Flask and Jinja for the Web Framework and Templating Language
* MYSQL for the database

Each time the user enters a item, it gets added to the SQL database Table.
And the item and it's price, along with the date it was added on, get's shown in a list of Rows below the input Field using Jinja.

Python used for the back-end for handling all the input from the user and executing SQL queries to save the Data to the Database
As well as a failsafe for if the user does not enter Correct Input.

HTML's Bootstrap used to make the website responsive and stylized.

Flask used as the Server it all runs on.

This was my little intro to my Final Project which I see myself using in the future most definitely. 

Thanks for reading.

Happy coding :)
